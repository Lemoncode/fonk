Form schema validator library.

![let's get fonky](./content/fonky.jpg)

Form Validation is a pure javascript form validation library.

It allows you to:

- Define validations that apply to your form in a declarative way.
- Isolate your form validation business logic from the ui.
- Unit test your form validation without having to mount the ui.
- Create reusable validation rules that can be easily unit tested.

[Live Demo (Fonky + React Final Form)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/lemoncode/form-validation/tree/master/examples/react-final-form/js/field-level-validation)


Fonk can be easily plugged into many libraries / frameworks,
coming soon integration examples:

- Plain Vanilla ES6
- React
  - React Final Forms.
  - Formik.
- Vuejs.
